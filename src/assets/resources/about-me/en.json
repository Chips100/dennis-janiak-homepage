        "Working at Dataport, I especially improved on architectural aspects of software development and applying SOLID principles in practice. By contributing to an in-house framework I learned about carefully managing dependencies and using semantic versioning. I was involved in setting up CI and CD with TFS in multiple projects. I learned a lot about focused development of solutions by applying principles like SCRUM, Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development.",
        "The projects I worked on dealt with several problems from the domain of public administration and government, like management of areas, administration of schools and support of public projects.",
        "I contributed to solutions developed with Angular + Angular Material in TypeScript, which includes working with npm, jasmine, karma and also jest. By using MongoDB in a project I was able to gain experience with NoSQL in a real-world project. In addition, I got familiar with several other frameworks and libraries, like WPF, AutoMapper, Ninject and Devexpress, as well as daily use of Resharper and version control with git.",
        "For further education, I took the chance to attend the BASTA! conference in Mainz in 2017 and the Developer Week in Nuremberg in 2018."
