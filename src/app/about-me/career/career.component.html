          Working at Dataport, I especially improved on architectural aspects of software development 
          and applying SOLID principles in practice. By contributing to an in-house framework I learned 
          about carefully managing dependencies and using semantic versioning. I was involved in setting up 
          CI and CD with TFS in multiple projects. I learned a lot about focused development of solutions
           by applying principles like SCRUM, Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development.

          I contributed to solutions developed with Angular + Angular Material in TypeScript, 
          which includes working with npm, jasmine, karma and also jest. By using MongoDB in a project 
          I was able to gain experience with NoSQL in a real-world project. In addition, I got familiar
          with several other frameworks and libraries, like WPF, AutoMapper, Ninject and Devexpress, 
          as well as daily use of Resharper and version control with git.
